                <h3>My Personal Logo </h3>
                <p>This versatile design has proven itself adapatble and eyecatching over the years. Fresh out of design school I sat in a coffeeshop for 6 hours in downtown Detroit to hammer this out. The result was a functional, beatiful, unique design that coninues to produce even years later. In using it to introduce this website, I proved a philosopical idea of the Bauhaus and Paul Rand - Good design has staying power.</p>

                <h3>Blurred Identities</h3>
                <p>A collaborative effort between several artists, it was ment to visually showcase the loss of self that many artists were feeling post-covid, and which was the theme of prominent art gallery in Detroit. This design was tapped to advertise the gallery's opening night for the exibition. a the orginal prototype hangs in my hallway, is frequently recognized, and makes for a great conversation pieace. </p>
