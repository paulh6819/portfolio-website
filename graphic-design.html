                <h3>My Personal Logo </h3>
                <p>This versatile design has proven itself adapatble and eyecatching over the years. Fresh out of design school I sat in a coffeeshop for 6 hours in downtown Detroit to hammer this out. The result was a functional, beatiful, unique design that coninues to produce even years later. In using it to introduce this website, I proved a philosopical idea of the Bauhaus and Paul Rand - Good design has staying power.</p>

                <h3> Social Media Campaign for Labbat Blue</h3>
                <p>In the summer of 2022 I was tapped to orchestrate the summer digatal ad campaign for the midwest which they wanted centered around Detroit. I had done the design for a modeling comany for a few years so I called some friends I had worked with and put together a series of compelling images. In terms of peope seeing my work, this was the most successful project I've ever put together with millions of people seeing these ads. When we go out downtown people still call my frind Mav "Mr. Labbat" .</p>
